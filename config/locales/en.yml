# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

        q2:
          question: "Vehicle Procurement"
          answer: "With a completely individualized analytical approach to the needs and desires of clients, as well as very good knowledge and insight into the state of the vehicle market and related services, in agreement with the client, we align needs with current market conditions in order to achieve the best cost-benefit ratio, as well as cost reduction using all legal and tax reliefs or advantages.\n\nDue to the volume of procurement, we are able to secure the best commercial terms from vehicle suppliers or importers. All benefits achieved in this way are fully transferred to the client.\n\nThrough a series of different analyses and using rich, long-standing experience in the field of vehicle fleet management and their financing, we develop specially tailored solutions aimed at optimizing operating costs (so-called TCO - total cost of ownership) and maximally economical consideration of wishes and real needs.\n\nWe also provide clients with the opportunity to align and balance the goal based on CO2 emissions and fleet costs.\n\nAfter the analysis is completed, the client receives an optimally formed vehicle fleet in terms of the ratio of total cost and technical-functional needs."
        q3:
          question: "Financing"
          answer: "Our company fleet management service is available for all vehicles, regardless of whether they are owned by the company or are vehicles financed through leasing.\n\nIn cooperation with all leading financial institutions in the field of leasing, we are able to offer a comprehensive solution for vehicle procurement financing with currently the most favorable conditions on the market.\n\nAt the client's request, we can fully take over the already initiated negotiation process with financial institutions regarding vehicle procurement financing, and thus ensure the best quality conditions on the market."
        q4:
          question: "Registration and Insurance"
          answer: "We completely take over control of the vehicle registration and insurance process, as well as their regular annual renewals.\n\nIn cooperation with leading insurance companies, we offer customized insurance solutions and conditions with maximum cost optimization. We take over the process of contracting and renewing liability insurance, comprehensive insurance and passenger insurance policies, as well as the green card.\n\nAdvantages that the client achieves:\n\n- No longer has to worry about contracting policies and renewing insurance. All vehicles are fully insured throughout the entire duration of the contract.\n- The amount of vehicle insurance is an integral part of the monthly cost of the fleet management service.\n- Also, we take complete care of periodic technical inspections and fulfillment of all legally prescribed prerequisites and documentation required for delivery and commencement of use of a new vehicle, for the entire duration of the contract."

          answer: "We fully manage all processes and events related to vehicle maintenance, whether it's regular maintenance or extraordinary vehicle repairs, as well as taking on the risk of all unplanned maintenance costs, and for this we ensure clients have fixed maintenance costs known in advance.\n\nThe vehicle maintenance process management service includes all vehicle maintenance costs, regular and extraordinary, as well as all consumables during the operation period (brake pads, engine fluids, consumables, wiper blades, etc.), regardless of their required quantity under normal vehicle use conditions and for the contractually determined mileage.\n\nAll vehicles throughout the entire contract period are maintained exclusively at authorized service centers using only original spare parts and materials recommended by the vehicle manufacturer itself.\n\nOur expert team controls all maintenance actions and costs, both regular and extraordinary maintenance, thereby ensuring complete control of all actions on the vehicle and their correctness and safety of use, and the large volume of procurement ensures the most competitive conditions and prices on the market, which directly affects the lower price of the maintenance package. Our professional team continuously monitors the actual mileage traveled and consumption of all services, and in case of indication of deviations, gives the user a proposal to correct the management contract in a way that harmonizes contractual parameters and thus avoids large deviations upon contract expiration."
        q7:
          question: "Tire Management"
          answer: "The tire management service includes additional tires, in relation to the duration of vehicle use and contractual mileage.\n\nThe tire management service includes, in addition to tires, seasonal replacement, as well as storage of the same during the period of vehicle use.\n\nWith our advisory approach and use of appropriate dimensions and categories of tires, significant savings are possible in this segment."

      title: "Rent a Car in Skopje FAQs"
      q1:
        question: "Do I need an international driving permit to rent a car in Skopje?"
        answer: "If your license is not from the EU or UK or not written in Latin characters, many rental vehicle companies in North Macedonia require an international driving permit together with your home license. Even when not strictly required, it is often recommended for tourists."
      q2:
        question: "What documents are required at the rental counter?"
        answer: "You normally need a valid driving license, a passport or ID card, and a payment card in the driver's name; in some cases, rental agents may also ask for your flight details or local contact information."
      q3:
        question: "Can I book a one-way rental from Skopje to another city?"
        answer: "Yes, one-way rentals are allowed on many routes within North Macedonia, with a one-way fee paid at pickup; international one-way rentals are possible only on certain routes and must be checked in advance."
      q4:
        question: "Is it safe to drive a rental vehicle in Skopje city center?"
        answer: "Yes, driving is generally safe if you respect local laws, pay attention to other drivers, and avoid peak rush hours; parking can be limited in central areas, so using hotel or private parking is a smart choice."
      q5:
        question: "What happens if the rental vehicle breaks down?"
        answer: "Most serious rental companies in North Macedonia provide 24/7 roadside assistance and, if needed, vehicle replacement within a defined time frame, so you can continue your trip with minimal delay."
      q6:
        question: "Can young drivers rent a vehicle in Skopje?"
        answer: "Policies vary, but many rental companies require drivers to be at least 21 and to have held a valid driving license for one or two years; some may charge a young driver fee for renters under a certain age."
      q7:
        question: "Are winter tires and equipment provided when needed?"
        answer: "In winter months, rental vehicles in North Macedonia are commonly equipped with suitable tires and sometimes additional gear as required by local law; confirm this with the rental agent when you finalize your rental plan."
      q8:
        question: "Can I drive my rented vehicle outside North Macedonia?"
        answer: "Cross-border travel depends on the rental agreement; some companies allow it with prior notice and extra fees, while others may restrict certain countries, so always ask before you cross any border."
